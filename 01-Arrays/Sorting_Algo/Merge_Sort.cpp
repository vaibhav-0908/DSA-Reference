/*it is much easier to merge two sorted arrays than to sort a large unsorted one. 
instead of sorting entire array at once, Merge Sort breaks it into halves repeatedly until 
we reach arrays of size 1 (which are trivially sorted), and then merges them back 
in sorted order. This makes the algorithm efficient and predictable,
especially for large datasets.*/

/*Time Complexity: O(N*logN), merging two arrays take linear time and array is recursively divided into halves (logN times).
Space Complexity: O(N), we use a temporary array to store elements in sorted order.*/
